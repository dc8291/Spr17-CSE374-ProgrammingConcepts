For the extraneous URLs, I tried to figure out the common traits between all of them.
Then, I used "inverse grep" to filter those out.

Q1) sets x-axis to "Rank"
    y-axis to "Size"
    x range is from 0 to 100
    produces the results into scatterplot.eps
    Looks for results.txt for data

Q2) The graph looks like all the top 100 are around the bottom the y-axis. 
    So, this didn't really tell us much about the correlation.
