1. echo tweet
      prints out "tweet"

   echo tweet > tweet.txt ; cat tweet.txt
      created a file named tweet.txt with the text "tweet", 
      and then cat that file which outputs the data in the file.

   rm ~/*
   mkdir tweet ; ls
      must remove everything in the directory before making a directory named tweet.

   echo tweet > tweet.txt ; grep tweet tweet.txt
      made a file named tweet.txt that has a word tweet in it.
      
   touch tweet
   alias "tweet"='cat tweet'
   tweet
   !!
      I first made a file named "tweet" that has no output.
      Then I aliased the word "tweet" with "cat tweet" so that I can only see the alias when I call !!.
      Next, I called the function tweet, which resulted in no output since "tweet" file is an empty file.
      !! only printed out the name of the alias, which is "tweet".
